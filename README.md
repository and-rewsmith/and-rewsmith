## Engineering
I am currently employed (on leave) with Microsoft working on edge computing for IoT devices. We write safe, efficient Rust code supporting low resource edge devices. A lot of the cool stuff we do is closed source. But the legacy product I helped to build is open source at [Azure/iotedge](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/graphs/contributors).

I do ML research on the side, with an interest in non-backprop-based learning methods. I am currently collaborating with some postdocs in the same area.

## Research
I am taking a hiatus from microsoft to join Allen Institute, where I am continuing my independent research in coordination with the University of Washington. I am working on biologically plausible, local learning networks.


## Volunteering
The climate is important to me. It would mean a lot if you would read [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/bxgd5p/single_most_important_stat_on_the_planet_alarm_as/eq6bvl0/).
